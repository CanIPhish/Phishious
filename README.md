What is Phishious?
=======

[Phishious](https://caniphish.com/Phishious/Walkthrough) is an open-source Secure Email Gateway (SEG) evaluation toolkit designed for red-teamers developed by the team at https://caniphish.com. It provides the ability to see how various Secure Email Gateway technologies behave when presented with phishing material.

### 📬 Secure Email Gateways Supported

### 🧐 Why use Phishious?
We're not joking when we say that Phishious is a world first in Secure Email Gateway evaluation. There is currently no other tool available (free or paid) that provides you the ability to scan your phish against an array of Secure Email Gateways. The closest utility is VirusTotal, however this specifically focuses on Malware detection and not Spam/Phish detection.

Through use of Phishious, you'll be able to freely test your phishing material against the world's most popular Secure Email Gateways. This is an invaluable capability as it provides you an indication of how successful your phishing campaign may be.

### 🔩 How does Phishious work?
Phishious exploits a common misconfiguration where many organisations broadcast overly sensitive information in email bounce responses and non-delivery reports. The sensitive information typically comes in the form of original untampered inbound message headers. 

By feeding this information into Phishious, it can extract the relevant information and detect when an email is likely to end up in a targets junk folder or be completely blocked by the SEG. When we scale this across many targets, we're able to aggregate this information to provide a holistic view on how various SEGs behave when delivered certain phishing material.

To better understand email bounce attacks and the resulting issues, please read the following [Blog Post](https://caniphish.com/phishing-resources/blog/exposing-email-filters) or watch this [BSides Canberra presentation](https://youtu.be/wqRlVtRYwWQ).

### 💡 Requirements
Windows 10 Endpoint, Windows Server 2012+ or any Linux system capable of running .NET Core 5.0 (see https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0)

### ⛏️ Setup
Phishious is a .NET Core 5.0 MVC Web Application. Accordingly it can be run on Windows using IIS or Linux using Apache as the Web Server. However the simplest way to use Phishious is to either use the [CanIPhish hosted Phishious Toolkit](https://caniphish.com/Phishious/Index) or to clone the project and then Debug it using your favourite IDE (e.g. Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, Rider, etc.).

### 🏁 How to use Phishious (Automatic)
Documentation is underway. Please check the GitHub project regularly for an update. If using Gmail then use a throwaway Gmail address with "Less secure app access" enabled. This setting is required so Phishious can connect to your Gmail account using a username + password instead of access token. This setting can be toggled by clicking here - https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps

### 🏁 How to use Phishious (Manual)
 <details>
          <summary><b>Phase 1: Identification of Vulnerable Mail Receivers</b></summary>
  <br />
           <p>As Phishious is designed to abuse public infrastructure, you need to identify a variety of targets who use differing mail security technologies <i>(e.g. Target 1 uses Sophos PureMessage, Target 2 uses Cisco IronPort, etc.)</i>. Identification of Vulnerable Mail Receivers can be found through manual analysis <i>(e.g. <a href="https://caniphish.com/Public/SupplyChain" target="_blank">CanIPhish Supply Chain Analysis</a> and <a href="https://caniphish.com/User/GlobalSupplyChain" target="_blank">CanIPhish Global Historic Search</a>)</i> or programmatic means <i>(e.g. <a href="https://caniphish.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4402066795919-API-Domain-Tools-Domain-Supply-Chain-Scan" target="_blank">CanIPhish Supply Chain API</a>)</i>.</p>
  <p><i>Reference: The accompanying images are of a CanIPhish Supply Chain Scan which shows a vulnerable <b>'Mail Receiver Supply Chain'</b> and a Global Historic Search filtering for a Vulnerable Mail Receiver</i></p>

          <summary><b>Phase 2: Filter Priming</b></summary>
  <br />
  <p><b>Step 1.</b> Email <b>non-malicious content</b> to a non-existent address at various target domains where a bounce attack vulnerability exists and a known Secure Email Gateway (SEG) is in-use. <br /><i>Note: At this stage, only Amazon SES and Gmail have been tested for the receipt of bounce responses. Do not use Exchange Online.</i></p>
           <p>
           <i>Reference: The accompanying image is of an email (within Gmail) directed towards non-existent addresses at 15 targets. Each target was uniquely identified and selected for their differing Secure Email Gateway technologies.</i>

  <p>
                                <b>Step 2.</b> Wait 180 seconds. Download all received bounce responses and then upload them to Phishious for Filter Priming. Upon Priming, you will see the status of all Secure Email Gateway technologies identified. For filter detonation (Phase 3), only these technologies will be targeted.
